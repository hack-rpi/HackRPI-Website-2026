			"We wanted to build something that mixes AI, hardware, and environmental impact in a way that's actually useful. Everyone throws trash away, but very few people sort it correctly—and most campuses or public places have no idea how full their bins are or how much contamination they get. trashCam was born from the idea of turning an ordinary trash can into a smart, reactive, AI-powered system that could see what's being thrown away and help facilities track sustainability metrics.",

			'"Green" is an app built to reduce traffic emissions by helping drivers find routes with minimal stops as possible. It analyzes current traffic for a route and dynamically recommends routes that avoid traffic hotspots, ensuring drivers spend less time in traffic even though, now the travel time has increased. Every time a user completes a route with fewer emissions, they earn points. These points can then be redeemed for discounts or rewards offered by environmentally conscious companies, such as WWF, National Geographic, and others dedicated to environmental causes.',

For individual users, it provides actionable tips on repurposing items to promote sustainability at home. Additionally, EcoVision’s video processing feature can analyze footage from conveyor belts in waste management facilities, automatically detecting recyclable and reusable items on a larger scale. This capability could streamline sorting processes and boost recycling efficiency in industrial waste management, making EcoVISION adaptable from personal use to large-scale environmental solutions.",
